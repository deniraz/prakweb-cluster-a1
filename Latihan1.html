            Laterano is a country in the world of Arknights, located on an island close to Iberia, RIM Billiton, Siracusa, and Victoria. It is a (likely) theocratic country where all of the Sankta came from with a constitution that guarantees 13 rights to its citizens, and an unspecified religion playing a major role in their society.
